<p>By Pam Young.</p>

<p>AusBIAS had their first meeting of 2025 on March 11.  I put my hand up to journal review this very exciting paper <strong>The crucial role of bioimage analysts in scientific research and publication</strong> by Cimini et al.  You can read it yourself <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698046/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all of my good intentions to put together a cohesive presentation went out the window when my WFH day was cancelled and I had to go into the lab, and then in the couple of hours leading up to my presentation when I was scrambling something together, my boss decided to call me 5 times. Luckily most AusBIAS folks know me are used to me flying by the seat of my pants.</p>

<p>So if you still haven’t just clicked on the link to the paper, here is my short synopsis.</p>

<p>In February of 2024, there was a Company of Biologists Workshop “Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis” organized by Beth Cimini or the Broad Institute and Kevin Eliceiri of University of Wisconsin (also my former postdoc advisor and a fabulous person). You can find out more about this event <a href="https://www.biologists.com/workshops/february-2024/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The problem: Bioimage analysis is a critically needed discipline, but is still often seen as an “add-on,” leaving researchers to learn it on their own though these researchers can have a wide range of computational background/ability. And though there are a large number of bioimage analysis resources available, including open source software, these are constantly evolving and don’t have community standards to track these comprehensively and determine what is useful/still useful.  So any materials available need to support a range of user abilities and rarely do.</p>

<p>The goals of this workshop were (directly cut and pasted from the website)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map our “landscape” – catalogue globally what efforts are already underway, where do current efforts overlap and so could lead to collaboration or de-duplication, where funding may come from, and who can we can tap for more community involvement and/or promotion.</li>
  <li>Bring together both users and creators of training materials and courses, to share lessons of what has worked and what has not in terms of training effectiveness and material dissemination.</li>
  <li>Curate the resources that currently exist, and brainstorm how these can be shared more effectively or used in novel ways, such as in the creation of flipped classroom curricula.</li>
  <li>Create a draft set of standards to recommend to stakeholders, such as funding agencies, organizations with influence on graduate training, or others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which resulted in this paper.  Which opens explaining that “Bioimage analysis as an emerging discipline.” <em>Effective BIA requires a comprehensive understanding of several diverse fields, including image processing, complex workflow creation (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11449385/">Cimini, 2024</a>
; <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7849301/">Miura and Nørrelykke, 2021</a>) and, increasingly, familiarity with data management, IT infrastructure and deep learning</em> (See Fig. 1 above)</p>

</a></p>

<p>The paper goes on to discuss “Enabling sustainable career paths in BIA”.  And this was part of what I really wanted to discuss because from earlier AusBIAS meetings, I think we all agree careers in BIA are not very prevalent and careerpaths not well-defined.  The paper discusses some of the reasons for this.  Funding.  Obviously.  And the paper includes an excellent spreadsheet draft to help bioimage analysists justify their existence in $$$.  And the need for culture shift in the world’s attitude toward BIA emphasizing the need for BIA specialists.  See sections “Encouraging a culture shift around the importance of BIA” and “Educating biological researchers about BIA”.</p>

<p>I think everyone’s favourite part of the paper was Figure 3: A concise etiquette guide for interacting with BIA specialists.  I felt this Venn diagram was missing <strong>“Bring snacks to share”</strong> in the “Dos” circle.</p>

<p>The paper ends offering What can we do? What do we need?</p>

</a></p>

<p>As well as 6 key actions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enhancing visibility</li>
  <li>Building empathy and collaboration</li>
  <li>Highlighting unique contributions</li>
  <li>Advocating for standards in publishing</li>
  <li>Securing support from funders</li>
  <li>Emphasizing the importance of user support</li>
</ol>

<p>I highly recommend anyone who made it to the end going back and reading the paper.  Clearly you are interested, and they wrote it much better than my summary.  Read it <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698046/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When we first decided we needed a website, the first question was obviously: what should our logo be.</p>

<p>At first I wanted something quickly, and took the obvious route of paying homage (shamelessly plagiarising) the GloBIAS Logo:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/globias_logo.png" alt="Globias Logo" height="200" /></p>

<p>In a fit of … what’s the opposite of creatitvity… I created this monstrosity: 
<img src="/assets/images/old_logo_DoNotUse.png" alt="Original Ausbias Logo" height="150" /></p>

<p>My thoughts were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the colours to “Aussie it up a bit”</li>
  <li>highlight the bottom right, where we usually appear on a map of the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>After all this, I decided it was best to actually ask permission from the GloBIAS organising committee and, while flattered, they were somewhat concerned about protecting their brand now that they’re a legal entity. This was entirely justified so back to the drawing board for me.</p>

<p>Next I looked at the Neubias logo:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/neubias_logo.png" alt="Neubias Logo" height="200" /></p>

<p>Well I liked the look of the network there, so that’s where I started tinkering.</p>

<p>I liked the idea of the <a href="https://napari.org/dev/naps/5-new-logo.html">napari logo</a> being completely defined in python, so thought I could follow their lead. First - I found a csv file with the latitude and longitude of the major cities in Australia, including their populations. Then wrote a script to put a propotionally population sized dot on each and connect them with lines.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/straight_lines.png" alt="Australia with striaght lines connecting population centers" height="300" /></p>

<p>That was cool and all, but as I had scaled the cities to the population, why not do the same with the lines?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/scale_lines.png" alt="Getting closer" height="300" /></p>

<p>I still wasn’t happy so decided to curve the lines, and add a colour map:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/almost_final.png" alt="Almost there..." height="300" /></p>

<p>That was it. Thought to make it more abstract I’d remove the coastline, had a design-minded friend (thanks Michael) help chose a font and the rest is (extremely recent) history:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/banner_logo.png" alt="Ausbias Final Logo" height="300" /></p>

<p>If you want to generate the logo yourself, all the code is in <a href="https://github.com/ausbias/ausbias.github.io/tree/main/logo_stuff">our github</a>!</p>

<p>Fun trivia: the logo initially included Geelong, but not Canberra. It was pointed out that while we do have members who work and reside in Geelong, missing our nation’s capital was perhaps sub-optimal.</p>]]></content><author><name>lachlan-whitehead</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="updates" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s a society without a logo?]]></summary></entry></feed>
