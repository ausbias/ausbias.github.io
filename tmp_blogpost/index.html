<p>By Pam Young.</p>

<p>AusBIAS had their first meeting of 2025 on March 11.  I put my hand up to journal review this very exciting paper <strong>The crucial role of bioimage analysts in scientific research and publication</strong> by Cimini et al.  You can read it yourself <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698046/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all of my good intentions to put together a cohesive presentation went out the window when my WFH day was cancelled and I had to go into the lab, and then in the couple of hours leading up to my presentation when I was scrambling something together, my boss decided to call me 5 times. Luckily most AusBIAS folks know me are used to me flying by the seat of my pants.</p>

<p>So if you still haven’t just clicked on the link to the paper, here is my short synopsis.</p>

<p>In February of 2024, there was a Company of Biologists Workshop “Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis” organized by Beth Cimini or the Broad Institute and Kevin Eliceiri of University of Wisconsin (also my former postdoc advisor and a fabulous person). You can find out more about this event <a href="https://www.biologists.com/workshops/february-2024/">here</a>.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/blogposts/20250417/joces-137-262322-g1.jpg" alt="..." style="float: left; margin: 1em; max-width: 300px;" />
</a></p>

<p>The problem: Bioimage analysis is a critically needed discipline, but is still often seen as an “add-on,” leaving researchers to learn it on their own though these researchers can have a wide range of computational background/ability. And though there are a large number of bioimage analysis resources available, including open source software, these are constantly evolving and don’t have community standards to track these comprehensively and determine what is useful/still useful.  So any materials available need to support a range of user abilities and rarely do.</p>

<p>The goals of this workshop were (directly cut and pasted from the website)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map our “landscape” – catalogue globally what efforts are already underway, where do current efforts overlap and so could lead to collaboration or de-duplication, where funding may come from, and who can we can tap for more community involvement and/or promotion.</li>
  <li>Bring together both users and creators of training materials and courses, to share lessons of what has worked and what has not in terms of training effectiveness and material dissemination.</li>
  <li>Curate the resources that currently exist, and brainstorm how these can be shared more effectively or used in novel ways, such as in the creation of flipped classroom curricula.</li>
  <li>Create a draft set of standards to recommend to stakeholders, such as funding agencies, organizations with influence on graduate training, or others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which resulted in this paper.  Which opens explaining that “Bioimage analysis as an emerging discipline.” <em>Effective BIA requires a comprehensive understanding of several diverse fields, including image processing, complex workflow creation (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11449385/">Cimini, 2024</a>
; <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7849301/">Miura and Nørrelykke, 2021</a>) and, increasingly, familiarity with data management, IT infrastructure and deep learning</em> (See Fig. 1 above)</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/blogposts/20250417/joces-137-262322-g2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Figure 2: Major barriers to effective uptake of BIA.">

</a></p>

<p>The paper goes on to discuss “Enabling sustainable career paths in BIA”.  And this was part of what I really wanted to discuss because from earlier AusBIAS meetings, I think we all agree careers in BIA are not very prevalent and careerpaths not well-defined.  The paper discusses some of the reasons for this.  Funding.  Obviously.  And the paper includes an excellent spreadsheet draft to help bioimage analysists justify their existence in $$$.  And the need for culture shift in the world’s attitude toward BIA emphasizing the need for BIA specialists.  See sections “Encouraging a culture shift around the importance of BIA” and “Educating biological researchers about BIA”.</p>

<p>I think everyone’s favourite part of the paper was Figure 3: A concise etiquette guide for interacting with BIA specialists.  I felt this Venn diagram was missing <strong>“Bring snacks to share”</strong> in the “Dos” circle.</p>

</a></p>

<p>The paper ends offering What can we do? What do we need?</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/blogposts/20250417/joces-137-262322-g4.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Figure 4: A vision for the future of the BIA community.">

</a></p>

<p>As well as 6 key actions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enhancing visibility</li>
  <li>Building empathy and collaboration</li>
  <li>Highlighting unique contributions</li>
  <li>Advocating for standards in publishing</li>
  <li>Securing support from funders</li>
  <li>Emphasizing the importance of user support</li>
</ol>

<p>I highly recommend anyone who made it to the end going back and reading the paper.  Clearly you are interested, and they wrote it much better than my summary.  Read it <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698046/">here</a>.</p>
