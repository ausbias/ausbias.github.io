  bio: >
    Lachlan has been a bioimage analyst at WEHI for over a decade, and now runs the Bioimage Analysis Core in the Center for Dynamic Imaging.
    Graduating in 2011 with a PhD in Physics (X-ray diffractive imaging), he now somehow finds himself in a biomedical resarch institute. 
    Alongside image anlaysis, he has produced several 3d-rendered graphical abstracts for high-impact journal publications, and post
    extremely niche humours animations under the hashtag [#microscopistsNightmares](https://www.youtube.com/@MicroscopistsNightmares). 
    He was a founding member of AusBIAS.

    Nicholas is a Senior Principal Imaging in the Institute for Molecular Bioscience Microscopy Core Facility. He has over 8 years’ experience working in a collaborative imaging facility, developing training courses, new methodologies, and data analysis pipelines. Nicholas completed his PhD in 2018 within the lab of Jennifer Stow (IMB, University of Queensland) where he used advanced light microscopy to make novel discoveries in micropinocytosis and cellular surface behaviours. He has worked with many researchers around the Australia on different imaging techniques and participates in international committees, advisory boards and working groups on various topics associated with microscopy and image processing/analysis

    Dr Pamela Young is the Light & Optical Microscopy Manager at Sydney Microscopy and Microanalysis and Core Research Facility at University of Sydney.  Dr. Young completed her PhD in Medical Biophysics a Program in Biomolecular Imaging in 2010 from Indiana University School of Medicine in Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy.  She also has a B.Sc Hons. (Physics), 2003, Indiana University and B.Sc (Mathematics), 2003, Indiana University.  Following her phd, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation at University of Wisconsin with Co-Mentors Kevin Eliceiri and Patricia Keely.  Now Dr. Young works with users to design optimal experiments for their research questions using SMM's suite of light and optical microscopes. She also trains and supports users on the light and optical microscopes and assists in the design of training courses and workshops.
