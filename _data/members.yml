  bio: >
    Lachlan has been a bioimage analyst at WEHI for over a decade, and now runs the Bioimage Analysis Core in the Center for Dynamic Imaging.
    Graduating in 2011 with a PhD in Physics (X-ray diffractive imaging), he now somehow finds himself in a biomedical resarch institute. 
    Alongside image anlaysis, he has produced several 3d-rendered graphical abstracts for high-impact journal publications, and post
    extremely niche humours animations under the hashtag [#microscopistsNightmares](https://www.youtube.com/@MicroscopistsNightmares). 
    He was a founding member of AusBIAS.

    Dr. Ellie Cho is the Application Specialist at the Biological Optical Microscopy Platform at the University of Melbourne. She supports researchers across multiple departments in using advanced optical microscopes. Ellie holds a PhD in Anatomy and Neuroscience, with a strong research background in ion channels, sensory and pain pathways, and digestive physiology. Her expertise includes techniques like fluorescence imaging, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology.
    In 2018, Ellie began exploring bioimage analysis and quickly developed a passion for uncovering biological insights through imaging data. After two years of leading and managing the platform, which broadened her perspective and strengthened her collaborative skills, she chose to return to bioimage analysis. Ellie combines her biological insight with analytical tools to help researchers see their data in new and meaningful ways. She was also a founding member of AusBIAS.
    Ellie loves helping researchers through consultation, collaboration, and workshops, taking a creative approach to morphological analysis as an image analyst with a biologist's brain.
