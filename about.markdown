# About Us

The **Australian Bioimage Analysts' Society** is dedicated to supporting and connecting bioimage analysts across Australia. We are a subcommittee of Light Microscopy Ausralia, and the [Australian Microscopy and Microanalysis Society](https://microscopy.org.au/) Our mission is to:

- Foster collaboration between image analysts and researchers.
- Provide training, resources, and best practices for bioimage analysis.
- Advocate for the role of bioimage analysts in scientific research.

## Our Goals

- Build a strong and supportive community for bioimage analysts.
- Organize workshops, conferences, and networking events.
- Develop open-source tools and share knowledge in the field.

We welcome all bioimage analysts, researchers, and those interested in advancing microscopy and image analysis.
