### How Do You Approach Image Analysis? AusBIAS Wants to Hear From You
By Lachlan Whitehead.  

### [AusBIAS Survey can be found here!](https://ausbias.org/survey-2025/)

Today AusBIAS is launching a national survey of microscopists and microscopy users to gauge how the local community deals with their image analysis needs. 

As analysts, we're obvioulsy aware of the growing imporance of bioimage analysis in extracting the maximum benefit from increasingly complicated microscopy data. We're also aware that the field, like that of microscopy itself, is rapidly evolving; keeping up to date with state-of-the-art techniques is a significant challenge. AusBIAS is looking for ways to help the community in this space by providing collaborations, advice, workshops and seminars. But first, we want to hear from you! 

With this survey, we hope to build a picture of how image analysis in Australia is performed and accessed. Specifically: 
 - Level of confidence with image analysis
 - Common tools and workflows
 - How researchers are accessing these tools, and how supported they are
 - Gaps in training and support. 

 ### Expected Outcomes

 We obviously can't promise to solve every problem immediately, but the results of this survey will guide our future direction as a society - and how we interface with the global image analysis community from our little corner of the globe. We will use it to put our resoures - such as they are - into areas they're most needed. Whether it's specific software workshops, larger image anlaysis courses, seminars, publications, youtube videos - the possibilities are only limited by the information we receive!

 ### Have your say!
 The survey itself should only take 5-10 minutes, and you can remain completely anonymous. You can optionally leave your email at the end of the survey if you would like to be contactable regarding your responses though. We want to hear from all microscopy users, from lab heads to undergraduate students, from microscopy experts to those who only just learned which end of the eyepieces to look into. The more responses the more powerful the survey!

Please feel free to share the survey link with your colleagues:

 #### Thanks!
 The Australian Bioimage Analysts' Society (AusBIAS) connects researchers, facility staff, and data scientists who use and develop bioimage analysis tools. We aim to promote collaboration, training, and recognition for image analysis as a key part of modern microscopy.
