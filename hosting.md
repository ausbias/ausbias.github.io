# Monthly Meeting Host Duties

Thanks for volunteering! Here are some helpful instructions for hosting the AusBIAS monthly meeting. 

## Before the meeting
### Organising A Speaker
Try and invite and confirm a speaker as early as possible, not only so they can adequately prepare but also so we can advertise effectively. 

### Create the zoom meeting
Zoom is by far the preferred meeting interface. If you don't have an institute license, shout out on the google group or contact Lachie to set up the link. Preferably invite AusBIAS members to the meeting via zoom so that it automatically creates a calendar invite (you will be sent the current membership list once you're confirmed as host). But also post on the AusBIAS google group. 

### Advertise
Again, as early as possible contact the LMA secretary amms.lma.secretary@gmail.com with speaker details and zoom link and ask to be added to the monthly LMA mailer - this goes to far more people than the AusBIAS list. 

Send reminders of the meeting to the AusBIAS google group. One and/or two weeks before the meeting is usually reasonable. 

Ask the speaker for a bio, prepare one, or offer the option to introduce themselves

## At The Meeting

### Configure meeting
Start the zoom a few minutes early - try and organise for the speaker to join early too to ensure camrea/mic and screen sharing is working. Begin the meeting formally around 5 minutes past the start time (normally 1pm Friday)

### Acknowledgement of Country. 
Use whichever statement is preferred by you or your institution. Acknowledge that we have members all over Australia and that the traditional owners may well be different for several attendees.

### Welcome 
Welcome people to the meeting, if there's any admin discussion or anything it probably makese sense to do that first. If the following month does not yet have a host then try and get nominations

### Introduce the speaker
Or let them introduce themselves. 

### Presntation
Entirely up to the presenter how they'd like to run this part. If they want to give a straight presentation that's fine, if they want interactivity even better. They can do almost anything - but keep an eye on the time or if they go off the rails.

#### Take questions
Try and encourage interaction, ask your own questions and encourage others to do the same

### Wrap up
Thank the speaker. If time permits feel free to engage in whatever random discussion has come up. Thank everyone for attending, remind them about next months meeting. 

## After the meeting
Nothing really. Your job is done. Thanks for hosting!
