# Monthly Meeting Host Duties

Thanks for volunteering! Here are some helpful instructions for hosting the AusBIAS monthly meeting. 

## Before the meeting
### Organising A Speaker
Try and invite and confirm a speaker as early as possible, not only so they can adequately prepare but also so we can advertise effectively. 

### Create the zoom meeting
Zoom is by far the preferred meeting interface. If you don't have an institute license, shout out on the google group or contact Lachie to set up the link. Preferably invite AusBIAS members to the meeting via zoom so that it automatically creates a calendar invite (you will be sent the current membership list once you're confirmed as host)

### Advertise
Again, as early as possible contact the LMA secretary amms.lma.secretary@gmail.com with speaker details and zoom link and ask to be added to the monthly LMA mailer - this goes to far more people than the AusBIAS list. 

Send reminders of the meeting to the AusBIAS google group. One and/or two weeks before the meeting is usually reasonable.
