<h2>AusBIAS Microscopy Image Analysis Survey - 2025</h2>

The Australian Bioimage Analysts' Society (AusBIAS) is running a short survey to better understand how people in the microscopy community approach image analysis. 

Whether you do a little analysis yourself, support others, or rely on your facility’s expertise, your perspective is valuable. The results will help AusBIAS and partner organisations shape future workshops, resources, and training to meet real community needs.

The survey should only take about 5 to10 minutes of your time, link can be found here:

All responses are anonymous. Please feel free to share the link with colleagues, students, and others who use microscopy data in their research.

Thank you for helping strengthen Australia’s image analysis community!
